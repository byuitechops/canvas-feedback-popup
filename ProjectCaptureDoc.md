# Project Capture Document for (Title of Project) 
#### *Author: Levi Stum*

#### *Date: May 8, 2019*


## Background

Brother Stokes has a 30-day demo to experiment with a qualtrics tool which allows us to add a feedback button.
This would be used in Canvas so if the students ever are having issues with a page they can give feedback specifying whether it's Canvas, the content, the quiz, etc.
This survey will also have embedded data so we will know exactlly where the issue is so we can address it.

-----

## Definition of Done

A working feedback tool that gives us the data of the user and web page they're on. Successfully implementing this in the Canvas JS (at least in the test environment) to see how it works.

# Requirements

### General Requirements

### Input Requirements

#### Definition of Inputs

<!-- List here a type definition for each input. For example, if it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. If it is user input, what will the user be asked for? -->

#### Source of Inputs

<!-- Paragraph of how to get inputs. From who? From where: Slack, email, server...? This also includes user selected options at runtime. How will we know what options to select? For example, in conversion tool, you'd follow the values on the Trello Board. It would also include the steps to get access to the information you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server. -->

<!-- List here a type definition for each output? For example, if the changes are directly to the LMS, list all changes that occur. If it is a CSV define the column names. If it is a JSON, give an example of the JSON structure. -->

#### Destination of Outputs

<!-- Paragraph where/who to send outputs. To who? To where: Email, server, directly to LMS...? It would also include the steps to get access to the locations you need, such as getting added to a Trello Board, or access to a server, or the LMS. -->
